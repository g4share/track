This solution gets tracking information from http://www.posta.md:8081/, with some improvements:
    it listens on 80 port, which is open everywhere (could someone explain me why they chose 8081?
          58752 might look better, imho)
    it is just only one page, you should not press "back button" - they use 3 pages
    you could be notified on the mail
   
This "magic" is done by a couple of PHP page (not the best in the world), and a shell script
which is run every 5 min by cron
